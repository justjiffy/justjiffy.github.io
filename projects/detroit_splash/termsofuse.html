	  <h2 id="choic">Choice of Law.</h2>
	  <p>For any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms of Use, his Agreement is governed by and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law principles.<br><br></p>

	  <p class="bold">ARBITRATION, CLASS ACTION WAIVER<br><br></p>

	  <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, by using or interacting with our Services, you agree that all disputes between you and Annapurna (whether or not such dispute involves a third party) with regard to your relationship with Annapurna, including without limitation disputes related to these Terms of Use, and/or rights of privacy and/or publicity, will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration under the American Arbitration Association's rules for arbitration of consumer-related disputes and YOU AND ANNAPURNA HEREBY EXPRESSLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. However, this dispute resolution provision shall not prevent either party from seeking provisional remedies along with arbitration in any court of appropriate jurisdiction. As an alternative, you may bring your claim in your local "small claims" court, if permitted by that small claims court's rules. You may bring claims only on your own behalf.<br><br></p>

	  <p class="bold">NEITHER YOU NOR ANNAPURNA WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT.<br><br></p>

	  <p>If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then the language in the preceding paragraph of this “Arbitration, Class Action” section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Annapurna.<br><br></p>

	  <p>The Arbitration shall be held at a location reasonably convenient for you, if you are in the United States, and in Los Angeles, California if you reside outside the United States and you and Annapurna agree to the jurisdiction of the courts there in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.<br><br></p>

	  <p>This dispute resolution provision will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. In the event the American Arbitration Association is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within one hundred and sixty (160) days of filing the case, then either Annapurna or you can elect to have the arbitration administered instead by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. Any provision of applicable law notwithstanding, the arbitrator will not have authority to award damages, remedies or awards that conflict with these Terms of Use.<br><br></p>
	  
	  <h2 id="waive">Waiver.</h2>
	  <p>No waiver of any breach of any provision of this Agreement is a waiver of any other breach or of any other provision of this Agreement. The terms of this Agreement may be waived or amended only in writing and only by the party that is entitled to the benefits of the term being waived or amended.<br><br></p>
	  
	  <h2 id="cumul">Cumulative Remedies.</h2>
	  <p>All rights and remedies granted under or referred to in this Agreement are cumulative and nonexclusive, and resort to one does not preclude resort to another or to any other right or remedy provided by law.<br><br></p>

	  <h2 id="sever">Severability.</h2>
